            <h3>CS <span>Student</span></h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Lea Rose S. Clutario, a 19-year-old from Tondo, Manila, with a deep love for art and food. Art is a huge part of my life, whether I'm creating something new or appreciating the work of others. I'm also a big foodie, always on the lookout for delicious meals to try. Outside of that, I enjoy playing games and watching movies, which allows me to relax and escape into different worlds. My favorite colors are black and red, it reflects my bold personality and love for creativity. I also have a soft spot for dogs and cats, whose companionship always brings me comfort and joy. I'm also deeply interested in exploring the world of computer science, where I can merge my creativity with technology to create innovative solutions. I love the process of learning new skills and constantly challenging myself to grow in the ever-evolving field of programming and technology.</p>
            <p>My dream is to become a software engineer at a reputable company, where I can grow professionally and build a successful career, and create a life where I can spoil myself and my loved ones with the rewards of my hard work. I aim to balance professional growth with personal joy, ensuring that both my aspirations and relationships flourish.</p>
